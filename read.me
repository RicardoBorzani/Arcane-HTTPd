To implement basic load balancing capabilities for Arcane-HTTPd in Sprint 1, you would need to:

Identify the backend services that need to be load balanced.
Choose a load balancing algorithm to use, such as round-robin or least connections.
Implement the chosen algorithm in the Arcane-HTTPd code.
Configure Arcane-HTTPd to route incoming requests to the backend services using the load balancing algorithm.
Test the load balancing functionality to ensure that requests are being distributed evenly across the backend services.
Keep in mind that this is just a basic implementation, and there are more advanced load balancing techniques you can use to optimize your application's performance.
