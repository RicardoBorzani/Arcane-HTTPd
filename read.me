To complete Sprint 2 F and refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability, you could follow these steps:

Review the existing codebase and identify areas that could be improved in terms of readability and maintainability. This could include code duplication, complex logic, inconsistent naming conventions, and so on.

Refactor the code in small, incremental steps to avoid introducing new bugs. Make use of tools like automated tests and code analysis tools to help you identify potential issues and measure the impact of your changes.

Consider adopting best practices and design patterns to improve the overall architecture of the code. For example, you could use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate the concerns of handling HTTP requests and rendering views.

Document your changes and communicate them to the rest of the team. This could include updating documentation, conducting code reviews, and providing training or guidance to help other team members understand the changes you've made.

By following these steps, you should be able to refactor the code and improve its readability and maintainability.
