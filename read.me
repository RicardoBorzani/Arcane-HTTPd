To complete task E in Sprint 2, "Write integration tests for load balancing and SSL/TLS encryption," you would need to do the following:

Understand the requirements: Start by understanding what needs to be tested and how it needs to be tested. For this task, you need to write integration tests for load balancing and SSL/TLS encryption.

Identify test scenarios: Based on the requirements, identify the test scenarios that need to be covered. For example, for load balancing, you may want to test how the server distributes requests among multiple instances and how it handles failures. For SSL/TLS encryption, you may want to test that all communication is encrypted and that the server uses a secure cipher suite.

Write test cases: Once you have identified the test scenarios, write test cases that cover those scenarios. Each test case should have a clear description, expected outcome, and steps to reproduce the scenario.

Execute tests: Run the integration tests and verify that they pass. If any test fails, investigate the cause and make the necessary changes to fix the issue.

Update documentation: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new integration tests.
