To complete the task of writing unit tests for HTTP request handling and response generation in Sprint 1, you can follow these steps:

Identify the different types of HTTP requests that your Arcane-HTTPd server will handle, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Write test cases for each type of HTTP request. Your test cases should cover all possible scenarios and edge cases that can occur during the handling of an HTTP request, such as invalid headers, invalid URLs, incorrect HTTP methods, etc.
Create test fixtures that simulate different scenarios for HTTP requests, such as successful requests, requests with missing headers, requests with invalid parameters, etc.
Use a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG to implement your unit tests. Write test methods for each test case and use the test fixtures to simulate the different scenarios.
Finally, run your unit tests and verify that all tests pass successfully.
By completing these steps, you should be able to write effective unit tests for HTTP request handling and response generation in your Arcane-HTTPd server.
