To improve load balancing capabilities with dynamic service discovery in Sprint 2, you can consider the following tasks:

Implement a service discovery mechanism to detect and register backend service instances dynamically.
Develop a load balancer component that can use the information obtained from the service discovery mechanism to balance requests across backend service instances.
Enhance the load balancing algorithm to take into account the current load and health of each backend service instance.
Implement a mechanism to handle failed backend service instances, such as automatically removing them from the load balancer's pool or retrying requests to a different instance.
Write unit and integration tests to ensure the load balancing and service discovery mechanisms are working as expected.
