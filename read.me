To implement support for SSL/TLS encryption in Arcane-HTTPd during Sprint 1, you would need to:

Obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate for your domain from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
Configure the server to use the certificate and enable SSL/TLS encryption.
Ensure that the backend services being proxied also support SSL/TLS encryption.
Write unit tests to verify that the server is handling SSL/TLS connections properly.
Test the SSL/TLS encryption functionality thoroughly, including verifying that client connections are secure and that there are no security vulnerabilities.
There are several steps involved in implementing SSL/TLS encryption, so you may want to break the task down further into subtasks or ask for help from a more experienced team member if you are unsure about any of the steps.
