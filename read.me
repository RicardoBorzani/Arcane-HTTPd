To implement support for HTTP/2 protocol in Sprint 2, you would need to:

Understand the key differences between HTTP/2 and earlier versions of HTTP.
Research and identify the appropriate libraries or modules to use for adding support for HTTP/2 in the Arcane HTTPd server.
Update the server code to use the chosen library or module and enable HTTP/2 support.
Test the server with HTTP/2 requests and responses to ensure that it is working correctly.
Document the changes made and update any relevant documentation to reflect the added support for HTTP/2.
Note that depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your project, additional steps or considerations may be necessary.
