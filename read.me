To implement support for gzip compression in Sprint 2, you should follow these steps:

Research and understand the gzip compression algorithm and its implementation in HTTP.
Determine the appropriate library or module to use for gzip compression in your server. For example, in Java, you can use the GZIPOutputStream class to compress the response body.
Modify the server code to detect if the client supports gzip compression by inspecting the HTTP headers. If the client supports gzip compression, compress the response body using the library or module you selected.
Modify the server code to set the appropriate headers in the HTTP response to indicate that the response is compressed using gzip.
Test the gzip compression functionality to ensure that it works correctly and does not cause any issues with other parts of the server.
Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made to the server.
Note that implementing gzip compression can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred between the server and client, which can improve performance and reduce network usage.
