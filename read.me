To complete task A in Sprint 1 of the Arcane-HTTPd project, you need to implement the basic functionality to handle HTTP requests and responses. This involves setting up the server to listen for incoming requests, parsing the requests, generating appropriate responses, and sending them back to the client. You may also need to implement error handling and logging to ensure that the server is functioning correctly.

Some steps you may take to accomplish this task include:

Set up a basic Apache HTTP server configuration with the necessary modules for handling HTTP requests and responses.
Write code to handle incoming requests and generate responses based on the requested resources.
Test the functionality of the server using a web browser or other HTTP client tool.
Write unit tests to ensure that the server is generating responses correctly and handling errors appropriately.
