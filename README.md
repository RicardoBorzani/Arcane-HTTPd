# Arcane-HTTPd
Apache-based HTTP server with JSF support. The Arcane HTTPd acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding client requests to the backend services and serving static resources. It is highly configurable and can be used for load balancing across multiple service instances.

## Sprint backlog

### Sprint 6: Basic Functionality and Integration with JSF.

#### Description: 
The goal of this sprint is to implement the basic functionality to handle HTTP requests and responses and integrate with Apache JSF for dynamic content rendering. Additionally, SSL/TLS encryption support and basic load balancing capabilities will be added. You will also write unit tests to ensure proper handling of HTTP requests and response generation.
#### Objective: 
By the end of this sprint, you should have a functional HTTP server with support for handling HTTP requests and responses, integration with Apache JSF for dynamic content, SSL/TLS encryption support, and basic load balancing capabilities. You should also have a set of unit tests that ensure proper handling of HTTP requests and response generation.

- Implement basic functionality to handle HTTP requests and responses (3 points)
- Integrate with Apache JSF for dynamic content rendering (5 points)
- Add support for SSL/TLS encryption (3 points)
- Implement basic load balancing capabilities (5 points)
- Write unit tests for HTTP request handling and response generation (2 points)

### Sprint 7: Load Balancing, Protocol Support and Refactoring.

#### Description: 
The focus of this sprint is to improve load balancing capabilities with dynamic service discovery, implement support for the HTTP/2 protocol, and add support for gzip compression. Additionally, you will write integration tests to ensure that load balancing and SSL/TLS encryption are working properly. Finally, you will refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
#### Objective: 
By the end of this sprint, you should have a highly configurable and scalable HTTP server with improved load balancing capabilities, support for the HTTP/2 protocol, and gzip compression. You should also have a set of integration tests that ensure load balancing and SSL/TLS encryption are working properly. Finally, you should have refactored code that is easier to understand and maintain.

- Improve load balancing capabilities with dynamic service discovery (8 points)
- Implement support for HTTP/2 protocol (5 points)
- Add support for gzip compression (3 points)
- Write integration tests for load balancing and SSL/TLS encryption (3 points)
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability (5 points)
